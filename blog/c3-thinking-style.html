      Everybody's brains work differently. They learn differently, the focus differently, and they enjoy doing different things. Understanding the way your brain works can be a very useful productivity tool! Once you know how your brain responds to your surroundings and to different workflow patterns, you can begin tailor your surroundings to suit your brain's particular needs. Trying to force yourself into a position that your brain doesn't like is a counterproductive endeavor. You're much better working <em>with</em> your brain to find a situation that suits both your needs equally.

      Dr. Anthony Gregorc believes that there are four basic "Mind Styles" that someone can have. You can read more about his model <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">here</a>. Of those four groups, I, apparently fall (partially) into the "Abstract Sequential" camp. I'm pretty close to the center of the four corners of the mind-style spectrum, but based on Gregorc's descriptions of "Abstract" and "Sequential", I'd say it's a relatively apt categorization.

      Thinking about how this applies to me in my work at DevBootcamp helps me realize just how apt it is! I've found that I have a very strong desire to complete challenges in the order in which whey were listed, and actively avoid setting up pairs that would have me doing a challenge out of order. This falls right in line with the "sequential" mindset, which is definitely the mind style I most identify with. This has proven to be a bit of a problem for my time management abilities. I've noticed that when I encounter a roadblock or a rabbit hole, I find it difficult to tear myself away and come back to it. Where my time may have been better spent working on something else to clear my mind, I instead spend it trying to overcome my struggles before I allow myself to move on to something else. I think I need to get better about identifying when I hit one of these stumbling-blocks, and forcing myself to step away and come back with a fresh outlook. I think it would save me a lot of frustration and, more importantly, time.

      I've come to realize that a sequential mindset can make web development a little more challenging than it needs to be. There are so many situations I feel I would be better off jumping between different parts of a project and building them all at the same time. Focusing for too long on one part of a site often results in that work messing up another part, then fixing those issues messes up something else. When I am more aware of how ever part of a site is affecting every other part, I tend to feel like I'm making much much more progress than I would otherwise. Going forward, I'm going to try to break my "sequential thinking" habits when I'm working on a project with many moving parts.
