      Recursion describes the process of something repeating in a self-similar way. Like when you see endless reflections in a pair of mirrors, or when you see a camera feed filming its own monitor, or like that horrifying gif of Gary Busey on the right. In code, recursion is typically associated with methods or functions calling themselves in their body. Let's look at a JavaScript example:
      <br>

<pre><div><code>function factorial(number) {
  if (number == 0) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return number * factorial(number-1);
  }
}</code></div></pre>

      <br>
      As you can see, the <code>factorial</code> function here takes a number, and then calls itself if that number isn't zero. The use of <code>number-1</code> means that it procedurally calls a smaller and smaller number until it reaches zero. Running through the logic here, if someone calls <code>factorial</code> with a value <code>number = 3</code>, the code will then run, and return the value of <code>3 * (2 * (1 * (1)))</code>, AKA <code>6</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recursion is a very handy way to perform repeating functions without the need for loops or iterators. It may not always be obvious <em>when</em> exactly recursion is a convenient option, and it stands to reason that a recursive function might be a little confusing to think about. That said, simply asking oneself "Can this be done with recursion?" from time-to-time might be good practice when dealing with tricky repeating maths.
