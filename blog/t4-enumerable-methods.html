      <h1>The map Method</h1>
      <h4>April 12th, 2015</h4>
      <p>
        The <code>map</code> method is one of the most versatile I've come across. It can be utilized in a near-infinite number of ways. Odds are, map will save you countless hours in you coding careers. Now, let's find out how...
      </p>
      <p>
        So! The way <code>map</code> works is that it takes an array of objects, goes through the objects one-by-one, and does whatever you want to them! That means if you have an array of integers, and you instead wanted an array of the square of these integers, it's just as easy as finding the square of one number! Here's an example of how this would look:
        <br>
        <br>
        <code>int_array.map { |int| int * int }</code>
        <br>
        <br>
        Yup, it's that simple! That piece of code inside the curly braces is called a "code block". All you do there is assign a name to the elements in whatever you're looking at (in this case, we called each element <code>int</code>)  which you pit inside the '|' characters. Then, you simply type whatever you want to replace the original values with. You can see why this might come in handy!
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, some of you might be wondering just how much fancy business you can put inside that block. And the answer, at least based on what I've seen so far, is anything! You could even put a conditional statement in there if you were only interested in changing some of the elements. You just have to remember, that working inside the block is a little different from working elsewhere. You have to make sure that your code returns a value, because you have to actually give <code>map</code> something to work with!
