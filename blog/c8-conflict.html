  <h1>Conflict</h1>
  <h2>[RANT INCOMING]</h2>
  <h4>May 10th, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      The most prevalent memory of a conflict I had was while working on my senior project for college. One of our group members, despite being an incredibly hard worker, consistently submitted sub-par work (frequently after the group-established deadline) and had a hard time taking anyone's advice without getting offended or defensive. This led to adversarial feelings between this member and the rest of the group, and frequently resulted in a significant amount of deliberation and re-doing of large portions of our group assignments. In one instance, our group had to write a technical report. We decided that we would split the report into roughly equal-sized portions portions for each member to complete individually, and one member (me) would compile, proofread, and submit the final version. We all agreed that we would each get our portions of the paper finished 24 hours prior to the actual deadline so I had ample time to compile the report, and get final approval from the rest of the group before submitting it. This individual was the only member not to meet the deadline, emailing his portion of the report to me at 3AM, two hours before the final submission was due. What's worse, his portion of the report was easily the least polished, containing far more grammatical and clerical errors than the other members'. I made as many corrections as I could, compiled everything together, submitted the report, and went to bed. Then, after our next group meeting, this person had me stay after so we could discuss the report one-on-one. At which point, he pulled out two copies of the report, one containing my changes, one containing his original version, and confronted me about the changes I made, heavily implying that I sabotaged his portion of the report to make him look bad. Needless to say, I was frustrated.

      Upon analyzing this conflict further, I obviously felt frustrated, but I also now realize that that frustration stemmed from feeling disrespected. I felt like, by this person forcing me to adjust to his schedule, my time was being disrespected. I also felt that by this person so quickly disagreeing with, or deflecting what I and the other group members intended as constructive criticism, that our opinions and our knowledge/skills were being disrespected. The overarching conflict that compounded these frustrations, was the feeling that the compromises we needed to make to appease this particular group member were hurting the overall quality of our project, and may also negatively impact our grade for the class.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to resolve this conflict, our schedule a meeting in which we could discus our groups dynamics, and attempt to create an environment where all criticism was welcome and we could air out our grievances. At the time, I think this did enough for us to continue with our project without having a catastrophic meltdown, but if I could go back, there are definitely things I would change. A big part of my focus during that meeting was to try to help this group member realize what he was doing "wrong", but doing so without pushing him towards being defensive or lashing out like he was prone to do. Instead, I should have probably focused on why what he was doing was frustrating to me, and how I felt like I was being wronged. I think this, rather than simply telling him what to or not to do, would have given him a greater awareness of the consequences of his actions, giving him a more complete context for how he could direct his actions going forward.
