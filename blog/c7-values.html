      <h1>My Values</h1>
      <h2><!-- The subtitle, if you want it --></h2>
      <h4>May 6th, 2015</h4>
      <p>
        What are my values? Accomplishment, achievement, challenge, confidence, effectiveness, efficiency, will-power. These are all the associations I have with feelings of general satisfaction and happiness. On a scale from 1 to 5, I try to live up to these values 4, 4, 3, 3, 4, 5, and 3 respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I had to pick one of these values that means more to me than all of the others, I think I would pick "accomplishment". I don't know whether I have a good idea why, but I do know that when I feel my most fulfilled, it is after accomplishing something I thought was difficult or worthwhile. Finishing my DBC work for the week, building something that meets my expectations, having a good time with my friends, just <em>doing</em> anything I find value in leaves me with a sense of accomplishment, and it is then that I feel most content.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last time someone asked me for advice, was just over a week ago when a fellow DBC student asked my for help on the "Car" bonus challenge. They sent me a link to their code in coderpad, and I was able to find and address the problem pretty quickly. Doing so felt good, because not only did it affirm that I have a pretty good understanding of DBC material, but also because I was able to bestow that understanding on someone else. At the time, I viewed both of these as accomplishments, and I suppose I still do. The former served as evidence of my accomplishments in learning how to code, and the latter served as a valuable service for a fellow student.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think one of the stereotypes that I worry about conforming to, whether or not it exists, is one of being an "outsider" at whatever software job I end up getting. I'm afraid that not having a formal degree in some sort of computer science might lead me to being less knowledgeable and/or less skilled than my peers. I think that focusing on my "accomplishment" value could help combat this. Allowing myself to recognize and appreciate how far I've come in the short time I've devoted to learning software should help alleviate some of the anxiety that comes with inexperience. Taking the time to think about this, and to recognize how important feeling accomplished is to me should help keep me on track to feeling fulfilled.
