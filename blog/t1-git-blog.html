      <h1>Version Control</h1>
      <h2>What is it, and why should you care?</h2>
      <h4>March 22nd, 2015</h4>
      <p>
        "Version Control" is a concept every prospective should become intimately familiar with. Trust me, it will make your life <em>significantly</em> easier. What is "Version Control"? Well, in short, it is a methodology that allows you to set up "checkpoints" as you do work on a project. An easy way to think about it, is to think of a "version" as every time you save your progress on a project. Ever written a paper and found yourself hitting 'ctrl-s' to save it every few minutes? Well, every time you did that, you were essentially just creating a new "version" of that paper! And "Version Control" simply keeps track of every "version" and allows go back to earlier versions at will if you decided you'd like to start over from an earlier point in time!
      </p>
      <p>
        "Git" is a very common "Version Control" software environment. If you find yourself working on a software project at any point in your life, I'd lay down a considerable sum of money on you using Git to manage it. Git tracks "versions" of the project by giving them three different classifications: "Unstaged", "Staged", and "Committed" (there are other terms people like to use for these, so don't be thrown off if you see any!). In normal-person speak, you can think of it as "New", "Prepared", and "Saved". To go into a little more detail, every time you make a change to a file that is being tracked by Git, Git will take note of that by comparing it to the last version in its memory. You can ask Git what the status of your files are by saying `git status`. Git will either say, "Hey, there are new (unstaged) changes, what do you want me to do with these?" You can then either tell Git to remove them, or you can say, "`git add` these to the group of changes I might want to keep." This will "stage" the changes, readying them to be committed (saved). Then, if you want to commit to these changes (heh) you can say, "'git commit' these changes!" Git will then save the changes, making them the newest "version" of your project!
      </p>
      <p>
        Now you might be wondering, "Hey, what if I'm working on a project with other people? How can I make sure they are aware of my changes?" Well, even if you aren't, you should be! A huge part of software development is sharing your work with other people so that they can either help you, or be helped by you! GitHub is the de facto method for sharing your Git-tracked projects with other people. It allows you to push all your local project data to the Internet, allowing you to share it with the world!
