      Design in CSS is tricky. It's not something that is every done right on the first try. It is an iterative process, one that is incredibly frustrating at times, and incredibly rewarding at others. There are a few basic concepts/terms that, once understood, will help you to experience more of the latter, and less of the former.
    </p>
    <p>
      First on the list, is spacing. There are three basic categories of spacing: margin, border, and padding. Margins deal with with space <em>around</em> your element. Say you have two rectangular divs, and you want to increase the space between each of them. You would do this by increasing their respective margins. Border is exactly what it sounds like. It is the border around your element. Say you have a rectangular div what is 100px wide. Adding a 1px border will give that div a 1px-wide line around its perimiter. But be careful! The that border has added to the div an extra 2px of width <em>and</em> height! Padding deals with the space between the edges of an element and its contents. If you have a div with a border that contains some text, and you would like to increase the space between the text and the border, you would do this by increasing the padding.
    </p>

      Classes and IDs are useful in CSS for applying universal settings so a range of elements, or specific settings to one element in particular. Classes are ideal for the former situation, where you have multiple elements that require settings that shouldn't be applied to other elements of the same type. IDs are great for situations where you have one specific element that requires a number of unique settings that aren't applicable to any other elements of the same type.
    </p>

      Positioning is arguably the most challenging part of learning CSS (at least, it is for me!). There are three main types of positioning you can assign to an element: relative, absolute, and fixed. Relative positioning puts elements in their "normal" position, relative to the other elements on the page. For example, if you have three header elements, one right after the other, relative positioning will actually position them on the page one right after the other. Absolute positioning, on the other hand, would not behave this nicely! Absolutely positioned elements can be placed anywhere on a page, and are completely ignored by other elements. That means that other elements can overlap elements that have absolute positioning. Fixed elements are positioned relative to the browser window and the browser window only. Other elements ignore fixed elements entirely, and fixed elements won't even scroll!
    </p>

    <p>
      Last up is "display". HTML elements have different display types, which behave quite differently. The two I will go over are 'inline' and 'inline block'. Inline elements are treated similarly to how images are treated when you first paste them into Microsoft Word. These elements are placed next to adjacent elements without a line break. They respect left and right margins, but not top and bottom margins, and they also cannot have their width and height set to a specific value. Inline-block elements behave similarly in that they are placed, by default, next to adjacent elements without inserting a line break, but they <em>can</em> have their height and width adjusted, and they also respect top and bottom margins unlike their inline brethren.
