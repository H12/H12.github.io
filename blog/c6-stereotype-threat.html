  <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
  <h2><!-- The subtitle, if you want it --></h2>
  <h4>April 26th, 2015</h4>

      Stereotype Threat is an interesting concept to me. Being a middle-class suburban white male, there really aren't very many racial stereotypes I am aware of that inform public opinion about what type of person I may or may not be based on how I look. But the more I think about it, the more I realize that Stereotype Threat might impact me more than I initially let on.

      In college, I often found myself walking back to my apartment alone, only to also find myself walking in the same direction as a girl who was maybe 40 feet ahead of me. Every single time this happened, I found myself terrified as coming off as malicious or as a creep. This fear inside me often impacted my behavior in odd ways. Sometimes I'd walk much slower than my natural pace just so it didn't seem like I was trying to "catch" her, sometimes I'd pull out my phone and speed up acting like I was distracted so to convey that I wasn't solely focused on the best way to not act like a total weirdo, and sometimes I'd even take a more circuitous route home just to avoid walking in the same direction as this other person. Every one of these, frankly, <em>weird</em> behavior alterations were made 100% out of the fear of being perceived as something I'm not. In many ways, those fears only served to justify themselves, as in my desperate attempts to not be perceived as weird/creepy/malicious, I'd engage in behaviors that could have easily affirmed those characteristics.

      Thinking about these quirks of my social-experiences in college in the context of "Stereotype Threats" kinda offers a clearer picture of what minorities must deal with on a daily basis. Whereas I only had to deal with my fears in specific situations, others need to confront them 24/7 because of the way they look. I wish I had some profound statement to make about fact, but the only think that really comes to mink is, "That sucks."
