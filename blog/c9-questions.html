      <h1>Asking Good Questions</h1>
      <h2><!-- The subtitle, if you want it --></h2>
      <h4>May 15th, 2015</h4>
      <p>
        Question asking is a form of art. Questions, when asked properly, are one of the most useful ways of gathering and learning new information. But despite this, it is remarkably common for people to put very little thought into their questions. Instead of constructing their questions in a way that increases the likelihood of yielding the information they desire, they do so by taking into account other factors, like whether their question makes them look ignorant, or whether they need to provide some context for why they are asking that question. The primary goal in asking meaningful questions, should be to generate meaningful answers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Good questions are concise. A good question should try to limit its content to the subject the asker is interested in. Providing too much extraneous information increases the likelihood of an answerer focusing on a part of the question that you did not intend, and giving an answer that doesn't actually provide the desired information. Conciseness also helps to keep the focus on the answer, rather than the question. Talking at length about the events that led you to ask a question only distracts casual observers from the content of the answer, and in an environment where there is limited time for Q and A, it ends up reducing the number of questions that can be asked as well as answers given.
      </p>
      <p>
        In asking questions, it can be helpful to keep in mind what it might be like to answer that question. Think about what kind of answer your question might receive, and use that the tweak your question to get the answer you actually want.
