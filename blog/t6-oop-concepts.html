      <h1>Object Oriented vs. Functional Programming</h1>
      <h2><!-- The subtitle, if you want it --></h2>
      <h4>April 26th, 2015</h4>
      <p>
        Programming languages come in many different shapes and sizes. Computers, and their lowest level, are simply moving ones and zeros around. So as you can imagine, there are quite a few ways one might translate those digits into something a human can actually understand. Two of the more popular styles of programming, are Functional, and Object Oriented. The key difference between the two, as I'm sure you probably guessed, is that the former deals with "functions", and the latter deals with "objects". What does that actually mean? Well, that's what I'm going to try to explain below. Let's get to it!
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's start with Object Oriented Programming. It's probably the easiest to explain in every day terms. I mentioned above that these types of languages deal with "objects". Don't worry, that means exactly what you think it means, and not some jargonistic double-speak. Objects are, pretty much, just... things! And the same way real-world things have properties, like a size, or weight or a color, so do objects! Also like real-world things, objects also have associated actions, or "methods", that they can do. Say you have a <code>Wall</code> object, well, you might expect that wall to have a <code>color</code>, as well as a propensity for having its color changed with <code>paint</code>! You tell your computer what new things, it should be aware of, as well as what describes and changes those things, and then you use your computer's knowledge to do stuff. That's, in a nutshell, how you can think about Object Oriented Programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, as I also mentioned above, Functional Programming deals with "functions". This means probably exactly what you feared: math. Where Object Oriented languages deal in "things" and "stuff", Functional languages deal in numbers and equations. Where before you had data that was always changing and shifting based on what properties it had, and what methods you used to change those properties, in Functional Programming your data should always stay the same, and any new bit of information should be created in addition to the old by way of a function. Want to know your GPA? Input your grades, and get an answer. Take a new class and want an update GPA? Instead of adding your newly received grade to the old GPA, you now just re-run the same program as before with the new information. This might seem tedious, but it actually helps for robustness, as it limits the number of ways the code can be screwed up. If your function works once, you can be damned sure it's going to work again.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope that does an okay job of highlighting the differences. It's that that any one style is better than the other, just that they are different, and could be more or less useful based on the types of problems you are trying to solve.
