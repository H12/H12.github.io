  <h1>Pairing and Giving Feedbak</h1>

      Pairing is a really interesting way to approach solving programmatic problems. I think it's something that would be much easier to do in person than over the internet. I've found that awkward moments where we aren't quite sure what the other person is thinking or doing, or what we should be think or doing, tend to arise frequently. I'm also somebody who "talks with there hands", so explaining an idea of mine to somebody without them being able to see me is an interesting challenge. I also find that I'm very apprehensive about making decisions for the other person. I feel pretty comfortable with the material, so I generally am able to form a pretty good idea about how to solve a problem, and I find myself frequently asking "does that sound good?" before doing anything. It makes it kinda difficult to get a rhythm going. BUT, when my partner and I <em>do</em> get a rhythm going, it's awesome. There have been a few moments where my partner and I are completely on the same page, and totally focused, and those moments generally prove to result in a huge amount of learning for both of us.

      Pairing feedback is an interesting animal. When I read feedback, I find it hard not to take things personally. I get feelings of defensiveness, like I'm afraid what the other person thought of me, whether they thought I did a good job, or whether they had a negative experience that I was completely oblivious to. I try to be conscious of my partner's feelings (probably to the point where I read in to things way too much) during the challenge, so the thought of obliviously being a jerk is kinda terrifying. In general, feedback is always helpful in some way. Just hearing how the other person responded is informative of what parts of the session were valuable, and what parts could be improved. I try to read between the lines on the good feedback so I can try to replicate the positive experiences. When I give feedback, I try really hard not to give explicit instructions to the other person. I just say how I felt and thought throughout the session, and hope that I can be specific enough so that the other person can use that information to inform their future actions.
