    <h1>The Wall</h1>
    <h2>Why is it so hard to start learning?</h2>
    <h4>April 12th, 2015</h4>
    <p>
      I'm sure we've all been there. We set out to learn some new piece of technology, excitedly imagining all the new and amazing things we'll be able to do with our newfound skills, only to be met with an insurmountable wall of jargon and gibberish that we couldn't possibly hope to overcome. Why is this the case? Why is it so incredibly hard to learn a new skill in technology?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, in my experience, I think it's a problem with "scope". In other words, a problem judging the width of whatever knowledge gap I was attempting to bridge. When I first set out to become a developer, I did so with an idea for an Android application. How hard could that be, right? I know exactly where all the buttons and things should go, why shouldn't I be able to learn how to put them in the right place? Oh how naive I was. I had an end goal in clear view, but the path to get there was nearly invisible.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to reach my goal, I had to work backwards to figure out how I was supposed to get there.
      <br>
      <br>
      "How do I make an Android App?"
      <br>
      "You need to install Eclipse."
      <br>
      "Okay, what's Eclipse?"
      <br>
      "It's a development environment for Java."
      <br>
      "Okay, what's Java?"
      <br>
      "It's an object oriented programming language."
      <br>
      "Okay, what's an object oriented programming language?"
      <br>
      "...It's a programming language that uses objects."
      <br>
      "Okay... What's on object?"
      <br>
      "DUDE, REALLY?"
      <br>
      <br>
      The first thing I learned after making my mind up that I wanted to be a developer, was the insane wealth of information I <em>didn't know</em>. That's not exactly the most invigorating bit of information. Even if you're able to pick yourself up from under the crushing weight of all the stuff you now realize you don't know, where are you to start? Not an easy question to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only pieces of advice that I would give after struggling through this period of self-doubt and confusion, are <em>Don't give up!</em> and <em>Ask for help!</em> No matter how far away you are from your goal, anything you do that you haven't already done will get you closer to it, and the most reliable to way to get some better direction along the path that you've chosen is to talk to someone who's already walked it. There is no shame in getting someone to help point you in the right direction, and there's no shame in briefly veering off the beaten path either. As long as you keep moving forward, you'll eventually get to where you were you wanted to go.
