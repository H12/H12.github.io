        Designing my own blog is a very interesting challenge. Everything else in DevBootcamp to this point has had at least <em>some</em> structure to it. There are generally some specific goals or guidelines to go by that help kind of direct your efforts. With designing this blog, it's completely open ended. In addition to creating a web-page, I have to create my own goals to help me decide how to present my content. I find this to be one of the most challenging aspects of web design. I suspect that this is one of those things that will get easier the more I do it, but for now, I think I just need to starting thinking more about content organization.
      </p>
      <p>
        With these particular design changes, I'm afraid I committed to a design too quickly and too firmly. Towards the end of my implementation, I had the unfortunate realization that every time I need to write a new blog entry, I need to update the links in <em>every single other post</em> to reflect the new changes. I suspect that javascript offers ways around this that would allow me to keep the same design, but also improve the flexibility of the site. But as is, I think I did a nice job of making things both more accessible and more aesthetically pleasing than they were previously.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, I do very much enjoy the challenge of designing a website from scratch. Its open-endedness makes for a significantly different type of challenge than I'm used to given my background in engineering mechanics. I look forward to learning to adjust to this new way of thinking.
